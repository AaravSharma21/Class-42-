| standard game design elements | pacman game elements                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| pc (playing chracter)         | pacman                                                       |
| npc (non playing chracter)    | ghosts                                                       |
| goal                          | to eat all the yellow dots before the ghost eats the pacman  |
| balanced approch              | the pacman game is balanced because three pacman lifes are three lifes and if pacman eats the __pallets__ the ghosts becomes pale and pacman can eat the ghost |
| adaptivity                    | stage by stage the number of pallets decrease                |
| chance vs skills              | in random direction any ghost comes vs how quick the player can move the pacman away from ghost |
| story                         | pacman is hungry and the ghost dont want pacman to eat anything |
| feedback                      | getting points and background noises by eating the yellow dots and the numbver of lifes given in the game |
|                               |                                                              |
